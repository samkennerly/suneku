##viz

The [viz.ipynb](https://github.com/Conductor/science/blob/master/conductor_data_tools/viz/viz.ipynb) demo notebook is a quick-reference guide for the convenience functions in [viz.py](https://github.com/Conductor/science/blob/master/conductor_data_tools/viz/viz.py).

Three practice datasets are included as CSV files:
- [Fisher's iris data](https://github.com/Conductor/science/blob/master/conductor_data_tools/viz/Iris.csv)
- [NY energy production](https://github.com/Conductor/science/blob/master/conductor_data_tools/viz/Energy.csv)
- [NY average annual daily traffic](https://github.com/Conductor/science/blob/master/conductor_data_tools/viz/Traffic.csv)
