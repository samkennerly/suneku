# sunekutools.ml

This (unfinished!) package is designed to make the machine-learning tools in [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) play nice with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

The scikit-learn libraries contain an impressive collection of algorithms which are easy to use and even easier to misuse. I often find myself spending time reformatting DataFrames as floating-point arrays, confusing row and column names, and making various silly mistakes while rushing to solve problems. The convenience classes here are designed to simplify these "trivial" concerns so that users can focus on data quality and model selection.

Click on the [logistic_classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/samkennerly/suneku/blob/master/sunekutools/ml/logistic_classifier.ipynb) demo notebook to see an example.
